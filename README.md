👨‍💻 DEVRYS CODE LAB - AUSTIN DAVIS
🚀 Project Overview
This repository contains Python applications developed in a Linux environment (Fedora VM) for educational purposes, focusing on foundational concepts in software engineering, networking, and applied physics (Ham Radio).
The environment is designed to support the requirements of Web and Mobile App Development curriculum.
🛠️ Environment Configuration
 * Operating System: Fedora Linux (Workstation)
 * IDE: Visual Studio Code
 * Programming Language: Python 3.x
 * Network Status: Bridged Adapter (Accesses home router)
 * Security Lab: Paired with a Kali Linux VM (32GB RAM).
📂 Key Projects
| File Name | Description | Key Programming Concept |
|---|---|---|
| oop_encapsulation.py | Secure Hash Generator. Demonstrates Encapsulation (protecting private data like __hash_object). | OOP / Security |
| oop_polymorphism.py | Device Report System. Demonstrates Polymorphism (different objects responding to the same display_info() command). | OOP |
| oop_inheritance.py | Radio Class Hierarchy. Demonstrates Inheritance (specializing a BaofengRadio from a general RadioAntenna class). | OOP |
| radio_horizon.py | VHF/UHF Horizon Calc. Uses the formula D = 1.41 * sqrt(H) to calculate line-of-sight distance. | Applied Physics / Math |
| pingsweep.py | Network Recon Tool. A Python script that scans the local subnet using the system ping command (subprocess). | Networking / CLI |
| web_app.py | Flask Web Server. A live web server deployed locally on port 5000 (used to send a neon green message to Cassie). | Web Development / Deployment |
